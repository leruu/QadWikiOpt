# QadWikiOpt
Some quick and dirty CSS changes to optimize my personal Wikipedia experience.

This CSS does the following:
* Sets the maximum content width to 780px
* Centers the content
* Reduces the menus to less options
* Puts the menu and search to the top of the screen

# Usage
* Copy the contents of QadWikiFix.css to a new Stylish style
* Set for URLs on the domain "wikipedia.org"
* Give it a name
* Save it

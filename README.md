# QadWikiOpt
Some quick and dirty CSS changes to optimize my personal Wikipedia experience.

It provides easy access to my usually used menu options and the search.
Also I find it easier to read, because of shorter lines, without the need of scaling the window.

# Changes
* Reduces maximum content width
* Centers the content
* Reduces the menus to less options
* Puts the menu and search to the top of the screen
* Removes a footer
* Removes stars for recommended articles
* Removes most languages

# Usage

* Copy the contents of QadWikiFix.css
* Click on "import", paste the contents and click overwrite
* Name the style
* Save it
* Enjoy Wikipedia
